# ⚡ GSAP Lab

Welcome to **GSAP Lab** — a personal space where I learn, practice, and build cool animations using the **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)**.

This repo will include multiple small projects and demos as I explore GSAP's features, from basic motion to advanced timeline-based animations.

Covers movement, scaling, opacity, and timeline animations.

## 🎯 Objective

- Learn the syntax and power of GSAP
- Build small hands-on projects for better understanding
- Level up frontend animation skills

Stay tuned as I keep adding more folders with new experiments! 💡
