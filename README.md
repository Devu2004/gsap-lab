# ⚡ GSAP Lab

Welcome to **GSAP Lab** — my personal space to learn, practice, and experiment with the **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)**.

This repository contains multiple small projects and demos, starting from the basics and gradually moving towards advanced animations.

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand GSAP syntax and core concepts
- Practice both element and text animations
- Build a collection of reusable animation snippets
- Improve UI/UX through smooth motion effects
